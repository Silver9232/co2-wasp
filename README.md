# co2-wasp
Repo to providee reproducible, end-to-end workflows, data sets and Python code to screen, simulate and build ML proxy models for water-alternating-gas and simultaneous-alternating-gas COâ‚‚-EOR scenarios using OPM Flow + scikit-learn.


\section*{Project Summary}

\textbf{CO$_2$-WASP} is a reproducible, end-to-end workflow designed to screen, simulate, and develop machine learning (ML) proxy models for \textit{Water-Alternating-Gas} (WAG) and \textit{Simultaneous-Alternating-Gas} (SWAG) CO$_2$-EOR scenarios. 

This project integrates the \textbf{OPM Flow} reservoir simulator with the \textbf{scikit-learn} ML library to enable rapid evaluation and optimization of CO$_2$ injection strategies. It provides:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Predefined and reproducible \textbf{simulation workflows}.
    \item Integration of physics-based simulations with \textbf{data-driven models}.
    \item Ready-to-use \textbf{datasets} and \textbf{Python scripts} for WAG and SWAG evaluation.
    \item End-to-end capability from \textit{data preparation} to \textit{model training and validation}.
\end{itemize}

The repository includes structured Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and example datasets to facilitate the screening and analysis of CO$_2$-EOR projects, enabling researchers and engineers to assess multiple injection strategies efficiently.
